USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

First you need to install python - I used 3.11.0 to program this, so if you wanna be safe install python version 3.11.0, but I'm pretty sure
future versions will work.
 --LINK: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe

While installing python make sure you add python to path, because this will allow the .bat file to run without needing to specify
any directories.

Once python is installed, run the .bat file in the same directory as this file.

Finally, run index.py and read those instructions on how to use the program
